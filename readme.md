## FAQ

1. Help installing

   - Mac
      1. Download from the [Releases](../../releases) page
         - Intel Macs: "*-mac.dmg"
         - M1 chip Macs: "*-mac-arm64.dmg"
      1. Move the Application to your Applications folder
      1. Open the application by double-clicking the icon
      1. If asked if you would like to open the application that was downloaded from the Internet, confirm. This is a standard MacOS security feature.
      1. Done

   - Windows
      NOTE: The application is currently not "signed" on Windows, as this is still a small side project and signing is very expensive for Windows. A few steps in the install process will say things like "Running this app might put your PC at risk", and you will need to click "Run anyway" if you want to use the app.

      1. Download from the [Releases](../../releases) page
         - Select "*-win.exe"
      1. Run the downloaded .exe file
      1. "Run anyway"
      1. The app will automatically install itself and open
      1. Done

2. Does it work on Windows OS?
   Yes. But MacOS is our priority at the moment, with such a small team.

3. How can I check for updates?
   The app will automatically check for updates when it is opened. If an update is available, it will be downloaded automatically.
